## Open an Issue

[Open an Issue](https://github.com/xalbauger-studios/blau-site/issues/new) to report any problems or improvements. Be sure to include some description to explain the problem/improvement.

## Submit a Pull Request

To submit a new feature, make sure that changes are done to the source code. [Follow our style guide](#style-guide) and do not forget the tests and attach the along with the description.

Try to solve a problem for each pull request, this increases the chances of acceptance. When in doubt, open a [new issue](#open-an-issue) so we can answer you. Look existing issues for ideas or to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.

### The 5 magic steps

1. Fork it!
1. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
1. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
1. Submit a pull request :)

## Building

First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for the build process. 

Install all dependencies:

```sh
$ cd blau-site
$ npm install
```

Once you have the dependencies installed, run `npm start`. This will run the 
main tasks described [here](./../README.md#workflow).

## Testing

After building your changes, run each one of the `test:` tasks described 
[here](./../README.md#workflow):

```sh
$ npm run test:complexity
$ npm run test:perf
$ npm run test:regression
$ npm run test:npm
```

And evaluate all the results - if everything is OK, then 
[submit a pull request](#submit-a-pull-request).
